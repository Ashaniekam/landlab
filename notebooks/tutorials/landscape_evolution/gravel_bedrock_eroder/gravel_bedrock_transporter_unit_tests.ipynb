    "The theory starts with a representation of a layer of sediment overlying rock. Each grid cell is assumed to contain a primary channel that drains to an adjacent cell. The cell may also receive inflow of water and sediment from neighboring cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes and effects include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic adjustment of channel width, based on near-threshold theory (implicit in derivation; not calculated explicitly unless requested via function call)\n",
    "2. Transport of coarse (assumed gravel-size) sediment as bed load\n",
    "3. Abrasion of sediment, which turns coarse sediment into wash load (not tracked)\n",
    "4. Abrasion of underlying bedrock\n",
    "5. Plucking erosion of underlying bedrock, which supplies coarse sediment\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, each of these elements should be tested, both separately and in combination. Two types of test are used: instantaneous tests, which are \"single iteration\" comparisons between predicted and computed values, and equilibrium tests, in which a small terrain is run with baselevel forcing (\"uplift\") until it reaches an equilibrium that is then compared with an independently calculated solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the tests should collectively vary each input parameter from its default value at least once. Input parameters and their defaults include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- intermittency_factor=0.01\n",
    "- transport_coefficient=0.041\n",

    "- plucking_coefficient=1.0e-6\n",
    "- coarse_fraction_from_plucking=1.0\n",

This configuration is small enough for tests to be quick and efficient, but large enough to include flow convergence (two cells feel flow into a third, which then drains to the open boundary)."
