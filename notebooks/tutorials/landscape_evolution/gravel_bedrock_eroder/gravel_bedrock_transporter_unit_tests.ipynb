    "1. Dynamic adjustment of channel width, based on near-threshold theory (implicit in derivation; not calculated explicitly unless requested via function call)\n",
    "2. Transport of coarse (assumed gravel-size) sediment as bed load\n",
    "3. Abrasion of sediment, which turns coarse sediment into wash load (not tracked)\n",
    "4. Abrasion of underlying bedrock\n",
    "5. Plucking erosion of underlying bedrock, which supplies coarse sediment\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, each of these elements should be tested, both separately and in combination. Two types of test are used: instantaneous tests, which are \"single iteration\" comparisons between predicted and computed values, and equilibrium tests, in which a small terrain is run with baselevel forcing (\"uplift\") until it reaches an equilibrium that is then compared with an independently calculated solution.\n",

    "### Test plucking erosion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we can use test cases with zero, thin, and thick sedimentary covers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory behind the plucking rate goes something like this. Assume that the bankfull plucking rate is proportional to excess shear stress to a power. Whipple et al. (2000) suggested that the block loosening rate would be proportional to bed-load transport rate, which in turn tends to scale with excess stress to the 3/2 power. They also suggested that the block extraction rate might also scale linearly to weakly nonlinearly with excess shear stress. Here we take 3/2 as a suitable choice for \"weakly nonlinear\", and assume that the combination of block loosening and block extraction results in a rate of bedrock lowering by plucking (at bankfull stage) that scales with $(\\tau - \\tau_c)^{3/2}$. Given near-threshold theory, this then produces the same scaling as the bed-load transport rate, with an unknown coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_p I Q S^{7/6} e^{-H/H_s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the exponential factor represents the fractional bedrock exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is the rate of lowering per unit bed area. To convert this into an average rate of lowering across a grid cell, one needs to make a choice. Option 1 is to assume that the portions of the cell outside of the channel \"follow the channel down\" at the same rate, by some process of rapid near-channel hillslope response. The rate of volume removal of rock per time across the cell is then the incision rate times the cell area:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_p = k_p I Q S^{7/6} e^{-H/H_s} \\Lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\Lambda$ is grid-cell surface area. The resulting lowering rate is simply this volume rate divided by cell area:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_p = k_p I Q S^{7/6} e^{-H/H_s}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the rate of incision does not depend on grid-cell size, but the rate of volumetric rate of rock erosion in the cell does (the wider the cell is relative to the channel, the greater the extra area that is effectively controlled by the embedded channel).\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2 is to calculate the *average* rate of lowering across the grid cell, by combining the area of the cell that is undergoing channel downcutting and the area that is not. In this case, the volumetric rock erosion rate is the incision rate per unit bed area times the surface area of the channel, which can be approximated as the width of a channel exiting the cell times its length, $\\lambda$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_p = k_p I Q S^{7/6} e^{-H/H_s} \\lambda b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the average lowering rate across the cell is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_p = k_p I Q S^{7/6} e^{-H/H_s} \\lambda b / \\Lambda$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a square cell of width $\\Delta x$, this becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_p = k_p I Q S^{7/6} e^{-H/H_s} b / \\Delta x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an aside, a kind of thought experiment. Suppose you wanted to reduce this cell-size dependence. Imagine you tried assigning some fraction of the erosion at the cell to some of its neighbors. Suppose for the sake of argument that you did this by considering the probability that a portion of the channel laps onto a neighboring cell. One way to think about it is as an average overlap. If a channel is 1 m wide in a 5 m wide cell and you move it from side to side so that its centerline goes from right up against one side to right up against the other, you have an overlap function (overlap length as a function of position) that looks like this: `\\___/`. Within the sloping bits, which make up b/dx of the domain, the average overlap should be b/4 (b/2 is the max, 0 is the min, and it's a linear function). So the weighted average is $((b/dx) (b/4) + ((dx-b)/dx) 0 = b^2 / 4 dx$. If $b=0$, the overlap function is of course zero. If $b=dx$, the overlap function is $dx/4$, meaning perhaps that 3/4 of the calculated erosion happens in the cell itself, and the rest is distributed among neighbors somehow. This treatment has the result of causing the $\\Delta x$ in the denominator to go away, which seems promising...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the zero-sediment case, we'll change the default plucking rate coefficient to 10x higher, at $k_p = 10^{-3}$."
